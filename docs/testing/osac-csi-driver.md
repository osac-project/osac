# osac-csi-driver

[Shared testing policy](../INTEGRATION-TESTING.md) defines tiers, ownership and
evidence. Follow this guide for suite setup and limits; inspect test source for
individual cases. Commands and inline paths are relative to `osac-csi-driver/`
unless explicitly marked as repository-root commands.

Touched-area requirements: [component guide](../../osac-csi-driver/AGENTS.md#integration-testing).

## Test tiers and commands

| Tier | Location / command | Exercises for real | Faked or omitted |
|---|---|---|---|
| Unit | Co-located Go tests; `make test` | Driver, node/controller mapping, fulfillment client, and validation logic in-process | Fulfillment service and vendor storage endpoints are mocked. |
| Unit (CSI sanity) | `test/sanity/`; included by `make test` | CSI protocol calls over Unix sockets and the meta-driver's routing behavior | The vendor controller/node implementation is `fakeVendor`; fulfillment volume operations use a stub. |
| Component integration | No dedicated real-backend suite currently exists | — | No real storage vendor, attach/detach, mount, or fulfillment deployment is exercised by `make test`. |
| Contract | No dedicated contract suite; track [OSAC-4845](https://redhat.atlassian.net/browse/OSAC-4845) for vendor and fulfillment-boundary coverage | No deployed fulfillment or real vendor endpoint is exercised | Fulfillment and vendor calls use stubs and `fakeVendor`. |
| E2E | `../tests/e2e/storage/` when enabled | Tenant/CaaS storage-controller lifecycle and StorageClass setup | These flows do not currently create a PVC through the OSAC CSI driver or verify CSI `CreateVolume`, node publish/mount, or pod I/O. They depend on the selected storage tier and environment gates. |

## Coverage notes

- **Request/response mapping, validation, or driver helpers:** Cover protocol errors and backend status mapping.
- **CSI controller/node routing or CSI protocol behavior:** The sanity suite is required but remains fake-vendor coverage.
- **Fulfillment private Volume API contract:** A fake generated client does not prove compatibility with the deployed service.
- **Vendor attach, detach, mount, or storage lifecycle:** The fake vendor cannot satisfy a real storage-backend requirement.
- **Helm/deployment changes:** Build an image when container/deployment inputs change.

## Coverage gaps

The current sanity suite intentionally stops at a fake vendor and a fulfillment
stub. Changes to a real storage backend, attach/detach, mount, or deployed
fulfillment boundary require the real-backend coverage tracked by [OSAC-4845](https://redhat.atlassian.net/browse/OSAC-4845);
do not label fake-vendor sanity coverage as component integration coverage.
The current storage E2Es validate orchestration and StorageClass setup, not the
full CSI delivery path from PVC creation through LVMS/TopoLVM to a mounted
workload. That end-to-end user journey still needs an explicitly owned QE test.
