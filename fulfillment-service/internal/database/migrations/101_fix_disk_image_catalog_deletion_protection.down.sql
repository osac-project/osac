-- Revert the trigger function. The catalog-items clause stays id-based (top-level
-- field_definitions, path 'disk_image', default->>'id' = old.id), matching the up migration's
-- clause: the up migration's field_definitions data normalization to {"id","name"} defaults is
-- one-way and is NOT reverted here (best-effort down, per convention), so a name-based clause would
-- no longer match the on-disk data and would silently lose deletion protection after a rollback.
create or replace function check_disk_image_not_in_use() returns trigger as $$
